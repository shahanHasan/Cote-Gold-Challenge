# GDG and CÃ´tÃ©Gold BlastCaptain DevFest Challenge 2024  
### **Open Pit Blast Recognition and Analysis Using AI and Machine Learning**

Welcome to our repository for the **GDG and CÃ´tÃ©Gold BlastCaptain DevFest Challenge 2024**! This repository is currently being set up and will serve as the foundation for our innovative solution to analyze open pit blast video footage using machine learning and computer vision techniques.

---

### **Objective**  
Our goal is to develop a solution that:
- **Reduces Costs**: Optimize blast efficiency to minimize material, labor, and equipment costs.
- **Enhances Productivity**: Improves blast design for fragmentation, digging, and movement control.
- **Promotes Safety**: Reduces risks like fly-rocks, NOx gas emissions, and excessive vibrations.

### **Future Features**
1. **Video Analysis Pipeline**:
   - Preprocessing of drone footage for feature extraction.
   - Application of machine vision techniques to detect and evaluate blast characteristics.
2. **Qualitative Blast Rating**:
   - Use of AI/ML models (e.g., CNN, RNN, or Transformer-based architectures) to assign ratings based on observed patterns.
3. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Custom evaluation metrics for fragmentation, fly-rock distance, and safety parameters.
4. **Scalable Framework**:
   - Modular design enabling future expansion and customization for mining-specific use cases.

### **Technologies to Be Used**
- **Programming Languages**: Python  
- **Frameworks and Libraries**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib  
- **Video Analysis**: Optical flow analysis, motion detection, and object tracking  
- **Machine Learning**: Deep learning models trained for pattern recognition and qualitative assessment  
- **Visualization**: Real-time graphical representation of blast analysis results
